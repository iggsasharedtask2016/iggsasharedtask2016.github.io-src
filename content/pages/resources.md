[GermaNet](www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/GermaNet/) - a WordNet-style resource for German

### English resources

There are also some English resources that you might use if you are interested in doing something using translation:

## Tools

[Salto annotation tool, Salsa API](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/salsa/page.php?id=software) - this tool was used to annotate the data

[Berkeley Parser](https://github.com/slavpetrov/berkeleyparser) - constituency parser with models for German

[ParZu](https://github.com/rsennrich/ParZu) - a dependency parser for German ([demo](http://kitt.ifi.uzh.ch/kitt/parzu/) available) -- note that a morphology is not necessary to run the tool; recommend to run the tool on pre-tagged text (use TreeTagger output)

[Stanford Parser](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml) - another well-known constituency parser with models for German

[sempar](de.sempar.ims.uni-stuttgart.de) - semantic role labeling software for German

[Shalmaneser](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/salsa/shal/) - the first semantic role labeler for German based on a FrameNet representation; the Semafor role labeler has no model for German; Shalmaneser also works on English)


[Shalmaneser - open source](https://github.com/arbox/shalmaneser) - an attempt to keep the original Shalmaneser and its components up to date as the original creators are not currently maintaining it

[convert_treebank](http://search.cpan.org/~tiedemann/Lingua-Align-0.04/bin/convert_treebank) (Lingua-Align-0.04) -- note that you run the tool on command line with convert_treebank [-i] infile informat outformat > outfile
